 je_gate_orcish_expansion_reason: "For generations, the orkish clans of Ankaris were divided—fractured by old feuds, scattered across the barren steppes, and starved by a land that gave nothing in return. But when the Magic Gate cracked open and the scent of fertile earth wafted through, a single warlord rose above the din of tribal discord. He spoke not just of conquest, but of survival—of unity. Under one banner, the clans now march, bound by hunger, purpose, and blood. The world beyond the gate will feed their future, and their unifier will carve a place for them in it, by steel and fire if need be."

 gate_orcish_expansion.1.t: "The Grasp of Green Soil"
 gate_orcish_expansion.1.d: "We have conquered enough land for the clans! Now we need to develop it."
 gate_orcish_expansion.1.f: "The ground is soft beneath their boots—rich, living earth that yields to the plow, not just the blade. For the first time in memory, the orkish people feel the weight of hunger begin to lift. The clans, once shaped by struggle, now build with purpose. Fields are tilled where war camps stood, and smoke rises from forges, not pyres. The conquest was swift and fierce, but now comes something unfamiliar: hope. The unifier’s promise has borne fruit—and the green soil is theirs."
 gate_orcish_expansion.1.a: "The future looks bright!"
 gate_orcish_expansion.2.t: "Dreams Scorched in the Dust"
 gate_orcish_expansion.2.d: "We have failed to secure a new homeland."
 gate_orcish_expansion.2.f: "The banners fell before they reached the horizon. For all the fire in their hearts, the march ended in ash. Fertile land turned hostile, not just in soil but in spirit—resistance fierce, alliances firm, and the gate behind growing quieter with each passing day. The Great Unifier’s vision remains carved into the hearts of the clans, but reality has turned its blade. Back on the barren steppes of Ankaris, hunger gnaws anew—and bitter questions echo louder than the war drums ever did."
