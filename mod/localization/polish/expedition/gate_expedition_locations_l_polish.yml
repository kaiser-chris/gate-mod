 expedition_location_gate_flavor: "Expedition Log – Gate Perimeter, Ankaris Side\n\n#lore We've made it through. For the first time, our boots press into the soil of Ankaris beyond the threshold of the gate—now ours. The air is thick with residual magic and smoke long settled. Just beyond the arch lies the skeletal remains of a field camp: collapsed tents, broken crates, shattered arcane batteries. The sigils of the enemy are scorched into rusted armor and scorched banners, but no bodies remain. Whatever happened here, it ended in flight—or worse. The land is silent. No scouts, no sentries, not even carrion beasts. Only the wind moves, whistling through hollow frames and stirring ashes into the air like ghosts. The gate is secure, but the stillness is unsettling. We hold the threshold now—but Ankaris is watching.#!"

 expedition_location_village_flavor: "Scout Report – Preliminary Village Assessment, Ankaris Expedition Log\n\n#lore The village lies nestled amid natural terrain, blending seamlessly into its surroundings. It appears largely self-sufficient, with cultivated land and strange domesticated creatures unfamiliar to our scholars. The buildings are low and practical, many reinforced with organic materials that pulse faintly with ambient mana. The locals have yet to approach, though they observe us from behind shimmering magical wards strung between rooftops and trees. Faint traces of enchantment are present throughout the area—subtle and widespread rather than concentrated—suggesting either a deep connection to their land or a cautious reserve. No direct contact has been made. Further observation recommended.#!"
