 expedition_location_gate_name: "Gate To Earth"
 expedition_location_gate_desc: "The Magic Gate we have come through. It is our link back to Earth."
 expedition_location_gate_flavor: "Expedition Log – Gate Perimeter, Ankaris Side\n\n#lore We've made it through. For the first time, our boots press into the soil of Ankaris beyond the threshold of the gate—now ours. The air is thick with residual magic and smoke long settled. Just beyond the arch lies the skeletal remains of a field camp: collapsed tents, broken crates, shattered arcane batteries. The sigils of the enemy are scorched into rusted armor and scorched banners, but no bodies remain. Whatever happened here, it ended in flight—or worse. The land is silent. No scouts, no sentries, not even carrion beasts. Only the wind moves, whistling through hollow frames and stirring ashes into the air like ghosts. The gate is secure, but the stillness is unsettling. We hold the threshold now—but Ankaris is watching.#!"
 expedition_location_village_name: "Village"
 expedition_location_village_desc: "A small [concept_gate_planet] village. How do we want to interact with them?"
 expedition_location_village_flavor: "Scout Report – Preliminary Village Assessment, Ankaris Expedition Log\n\n#lore The village lies nestled amid natural terrain, blending seamlessly into its surroundings. It appears largely self-sufficient, with cultivated land and strange domesticated creatures unfamiliar to our scholars. The buildings are low and practical, many reinforced with organic materials that pulse faintly with ambient mana. The locals have yet to approach, though they observe us from behind shimmering magical wards strung between rooftops and trees. Faint traces of enchantment are present throughout the area—subtle and widespread rather than concentrated—suggesting either a deep connection to their land or a cautious reserve. No direct contact has been made. Further observation recommended.#!"
 expedition_location_castle_name: "Castle"
 expedition_location_castle_desc: "An [concept_gate_planet] castle. How do we want to interact with them?"
 expedition_location_castle_flavor: "Scout Report – Fortified Hold, Ankaris Expedition Log\n\n#lore Our advance team has come upon a well-maintained castle rising from a low ridge above the nearby plain. The fortress appears fully occupied and in excellent condition, with smooth stonework, clean battlements, and freshly flown banners displaying a sigil unknown to our heraldry. The grounds show signs of regular patrols and disciplined upkeep, and a small village has grown around its outer walls, likely serving as support for the garrison and the lord’s court. No signs of conflict or unrest are evident—on the contrary, the area radiates stability and order. The central keep is topped with a glass-domed spire that emits a soft magical glow at night, suggesting the presence of arcane advisors or wards. The castle seems to be the seat of a local power, possibly a noble or governor, and could prove valuable for diplomatic overtures.#!"
 expedition_location_town_name: "Town"
 expedition_location_town_desc: "An [concept_gate_planet] town. How do we want to interact with them?"
 expedition_location_town_flavor: "Scout Report – Unknown Town Settlement, Ankaris Expedition Log\n\n#lore Initial recon has identified a sizable settlement nestled in a shallow valley, ringed by layered stone walls and wooden palisades reinforced with local minerals. The town appears to be self-sufficient, with terraced fields, wind-powered mills, and several elevated watchposts. Unlike the smaller villages we've passed, this location shows signs of deliberate organization—wide streets, district divisions, and a central spire that glows faintly with arcane energy at night. Movement is visible at the gates, and the populace seems alert but not openly hostile. Several banners are hung along the ramparts, though their meaning is still unknown. No direct contact has been initiated, but the size and structure suggest this town could serve as a local trade hub or even a regional seat of influence.#!"
