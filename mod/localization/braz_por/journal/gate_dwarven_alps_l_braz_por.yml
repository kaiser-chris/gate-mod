 je_dwarven_integration_of_germans: "Integrating Germans"
 je_dwarven_integration_of_germans_reason: "The dwarven nation of $GMK$, carved into the heart of the Alps, finds itself in the throes of an unprecedented transformation. Since entering a union with their German-speaking neighbors, an effort to forge a unified alpine identity has begun, blending the ancient traditions of the dwarves with the human customs of Bavaria. Dwarven guilds now deliberate alongside human councils, and the clang of smithing hammers echoes with new Bavarian melodies.\n$gate_journal_delimiter$\nBut the process is far from seamless. Tensions brew as dwarves resist changes to their centuries-old customs, while some humans struggle to accept their role in a society dominated by stone-bound halls and rigid guild hierarchies. Whispers of dissent grow louder on both sides—humans fear cultural erasure, while dwarves grumble about compromises diluting their heritage. In the icy shadow of the peaks, unity feels as fragile as a vein of unmined ore, threatening to splinter under the weight of old pride and new alliances."

 je_dwarven_alps_status: "We claim all of our home mountain range."
 je_dwarven_alps_reason: "$GMK$’s ultimate goal is the unification of the Alps under its banner, an aspiration that places Switzerland squarely in its sights. Unlike many nations that would resort to conquest, the dwarves of $GMK$ prefer a diplomatic approach, seeking to persuade Switzerland to join their fold voluntarily. They envision a partnership of equals, with shared prosperity and cultural exchange, rather than a subjugation of one state by another.\n$gate_journal_delimiter$\nTo achieve this, $GMK$ knows it must prove its capacity for fair governance and cultural integration. The successful assimilation of their existing German-speaking population is not just a domestic imperative but also a crucial test case. Switzerland must see itself as an equal partner in any unification, not as a subordinate to dwarven interests."
