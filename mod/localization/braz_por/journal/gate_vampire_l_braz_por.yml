 gate_vampire.2.f: "Under the cover of darkness, the faithful strike with calculated precision. The hunt for the [GetReligion('gate_lunar_masquerade').GetNameNoFormatting] and their [GetCulture('vampire').GetNameNoFormatting] kin unfolds as a quiet but ruthless inquisition. Armed with silvered blades and whispered blessings, zealots and holy enforcers move through the cities and countryside alike, rooting out those who claim the cursed gifts of the night."

 gate_vampire.3.d: "A local clergyman was attacked by a monstrous winged beast."
 gate_vampire.3.f: "The quiet countryside was shaken when a humble clergyman known for his unwavering faith, was set upon by a monstrous winged beast as he returned from evening prayers. The villagers found him at dawn, his robes torn and his body marked by deep wounds. Yet, to their astonishment, he did not succumb to fever or frailty—rather, he healed with unnatural speed.\n\nSome whisper that his gaze lingers too long in the dark and that his presence now carries a weight unseen before."

The populace, once enthralled by promises of immortality and strength, now recoils in horror as reports emerge of missing vagrants, secretive gatherings, and the quiet culling of the weak. The Lunar Masquerade, once a fringe cult, has woven itself into the highest echelons of power, its influence gripping the courts and councils with an iron hand wrapped in velvet.\n\nThe streets seethe with unrest. Priests decry the curse from their pulpits, while merchants and farmers alike demand to know what price they will be forced to pay. Yet, among the elite, the question is whispered in different tones: Is the horror worth the power? As dissent brews, the fate of the nation hangs in the balance—will the people rebel, or will the thirst of their rulers become law?"

His presence is unsettling—his eyes gleam in the dim glow of lamps, his voice carries an unnatural weight, and his rivals find themselves edged out of business in ways both mysterious and final."
