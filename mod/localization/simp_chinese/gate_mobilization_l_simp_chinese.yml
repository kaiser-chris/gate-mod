 mobilization_option_ritual_magic_desc: "Skilled mages can provide devastating results on the battlefield."
 mobilization_option_healing_circles: "Healing Circles"
 mobilization_option_healing_circles_desc: "Originally developed in sacred rituals, their use has expanded to warzones, disaster relief efforts, and even urban clinics, proving that magic can be as much a force for healing as for destruction."
 mobilization_option_battlefield_wards: "Battlefield Wards"
 mobilization_option_battlefield_wards_desc: "The creation of a Battlefield Ward requires a skilled mage, often accompanied by an assistant to manage the complex mana arrays and maintain focus under the pressures of combat. The wards themselves, though powerful, are not without limitations—intense firepower or sustained magical assault can overload them, causing sudden collapse. Still, their strategic value is undeniable, turning otherwise untenable positions into fortified strongholds."
