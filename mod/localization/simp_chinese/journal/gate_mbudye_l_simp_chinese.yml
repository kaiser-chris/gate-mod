 gate_mbudye.1.desc: "The [GetCulture('lunda').GetName] nations under our control convert to the [GetReligion('gate_golden_religion').GetName]."
 gate_mbudye.1.f: "After years of tireless preaching, political maneuvering, and bitter conflict, the Lunda have finally embraced the faith of the Golden Blessing. The Mbudye council, once staunch guardians of their ancestral traditions, now kneel in solemn prayer alongside elven priests. Yet the path to this moment was stained with blood and marred by strife—villages burned, families divided, and histories rewritten. As golden banners rise over Lunda lands, the question lingers: will this new faith bring unity, or will old wounds fester beneath the surface?"

 gate_mbudye.10.f: "Under the shroud of night, the pristine walls of a newly erected Golden Blessing temple were desecrated with bold, defiant Lunda symbols. The act has left the elven clergy outraged and local villagers uneasy, each accusing the other of sabotage. The temple now stands as a stark symbol of the tension simmering between tradition and conversion."

 gate_mbudye.11.f: "Whispers spread like wildfire: the Dominion allegedly plans to dissolve the cherished Lunda village councils. Though unfounded, the rumor sows widespread unease among the Lunda populace, prompting protests and urgent pleas for clarification. The Arcturian administration scrambles to contain the fallout, but suspicion lingers in the air."

 gate_mbudye.12.desc: "A public in the state of [SCOPE.sState('mbudye_event_state').GetName] in [SCOPE.sCountry('mbudye_event_country').GetNameNoFlag] goes awry."
 gate_mbudye.12.f: "A public ceremony meant to honor shared harmony descends into chaos as elven clergy misinterpret a Lunda ritual as heretical. The misunderstanding sparks a heated dispute, with voices raised on both sides. What began as an opportunity for unity now threatens to deepen the divide, forcing Dominion officials to act swiftly to prevent further escalation."

 gate_mbudye.13.f: "In a rare display of unity, an elven priest and a renowned Lunda healer joined forces for a public healing ritual in the heart of a Lunda village. Combining the priest's arcane chants with the healer's traditional methods, the ceremony drew a crowd that watched in awe as the sick and injured found relief. The event became a symbol of what collaboration could achieve, fostering mutual respect and hope for a more harmonious future."

 gate_mbudye.15.f: "As the uprising erupted, the Bambudye struck swiftly and decisively. Under the cover of darkness, their operatives infiltrated Arcturian supply depots, setting stores of food, weapons, and mana crystals ablaze. The Dominion’s forces awoke to chaos, their supply lines severed and their morale shaken by the shadowy hand of rebellion."

The act sent shock waves through the region, fueling outrage among the Lunda and deepening the divide between the Dominion and its subjects. What was meant to be a mission of faith now teetered on the edge of violent backlash."

 gate_mbudye.3.f: "An elven priest, adorned in the shimmering vestments of the Arcturian Dominion, approached a Lunda village, intent on spreading the celestial faith. However, the villagers, united in their resolve, stood firm at the entrance, barring the priest’s path. “We honor our ancestors and their wisdom,” the village elder declared. The priest, though outwardly composed, returned with a heavy heart—and a report to the Dominion leaders, who now must decide how to handle this act of defiance."

 gate_mbudye.6.f: "Despite the efforts of the Dominion's most skilled investigators, the trail has gone cold. Evidence points to the Bambudye, yet no culprits have been apprehended.
