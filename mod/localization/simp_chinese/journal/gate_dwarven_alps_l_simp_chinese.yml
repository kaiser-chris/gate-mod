 je_dwarven_alps_reason: "$GATE_MK$’s ultimate goal is the unification of the Alps under its banner, an aspiration that places Switzerland squarely in its sights. Unlike many nations that would resort to conquest, the dwarves of $GATE_MK$ prefer a diplomatic approach, seeking to persuade Switzerland to join their fold voluntarily. They envision a partnership of equals, with shared prosperity and cultural exchange, rather than a subjugation of one state by another.\n$gate_journal_delimiter$\nTo achieve this, $GATE_MK$ knows it must prove its capacity for fair governance and cultural integration. The successful assimilation of their existing German-speaking population is not just a domestic imperative but also a crucial test case. Switzerland must see itself as an equal partner in any unification, not as a subordinate to dwarven interests."
