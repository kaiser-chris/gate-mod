# Classes
 orc_shamans: "Ork Shamans"
 orc_shamans_desc: "Ork Shamans are a mystical and revered social class within ork societies, blending spirituality with powerful elemental magic. These individuals serve as the spiritual leaders, healers, and seers of their tribes, wielding great influence and respect. Ork Shamans are believed to communicate with ancient spirits, elemental forces, and the primal energies of the natural world. They often act as mediators between the physical and spiritual realms, offering guidance during times of war, famine, or important rituals."
 orc_lords: "Ork Lords"
 orc_lords_desc: "Ork Lords are the dominant and commanding social class within ork societies, embodying the strength, authority, and martial prowess that are central to ork culture. These individuals are powerful warlords, rulers, and military leaders who command respect and fear across their tribes or clans. Ork Lords are typically larger, more battle-hardened, and more cunning than other members of their society, rising to prominence through their ability to lead their warriors to victory in brutal combat."
 orc_citizens: "Ork Citizens"
 orc_citizens_desc: "Ork Citizens are the everyday members of ork society, forming the backbone of their communities. While they may not hold the same power or prestige as Ork Lords or Shamans, Ork Citizens are essential to the functioning of ork tribes and settlements. They include a wide variety of roles, from skilled craftsmen and farmers to warriors and traders, each contributing to the tribe's survival and prosperity. Known for their resilience, hardworking nature, and loyalty to their leaders, Ork Citizens are often the ones who maintain the infrastructure, gather resources, and support their more powerful counterparts. While their lives may be shaped by the constant demands of survival and war, Ork Citizens enjoy a strong sense of community and pride in their heritage."
 orc_soldiers: "Ork Soldiers"
 orc_soldiers_desc: "Ork Soldiers are the fierce and disciplined warriors at the heart of ork society, trained for battle from a young age. They serve as the primary fighting force in wars and raids, loyal to their Ork Lords and driven by a thirst for combat and glory. Known for their brute strength, raw aggression, and relentless determination, Ork Soldiers are often armed with heavy weaponry, crude but effective armor, and a deep sense of camaraderie. Though they may not hold high ranks, their valor on the battlefield earns them respect, and their role is crucial in expanding and defending ork territories. Through bloodshed and conquest, Ork Soldiers embody the warrior spirit that defines their people."
 orc_lowers: "Ork Lowers"
 orc_lowers_desc: "Ork Lowers are the lowest social class in ork society, often tasked with menial labor and serving the needs of higher-ranking orks. This group includes those who perform essential but less prestigious roles, such as laborers, servitors, and apprentices. While they may not have the same rights or respect as Ork Citizens or Soldiers, their work is vital to the survival and functioning of the tribe. Ork Lowers often live in harsh conditions, with limited opportunities for advancement, yet they are known for their resilience, determination, and strong sense of community. Despite their low status, they are essential to ork society’s day-to-day operations and often form tight-knit bonds with one another."
