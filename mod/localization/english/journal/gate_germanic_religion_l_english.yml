 je_gate_germanic_religion: "Converting our Brothers"
 je_gate_germanic_religion_reason: "The halls of power in Germany echo with ancient hymns long thought silenced. Where crosses once stood, oak leaves now adorn the banners of the faithful. The old gods have returned to the heartland, and their priests speak with voices that shake stone and stir soul. Now, eyes turn northward—to the Low Countries, where the thunder has not yet been heard."
