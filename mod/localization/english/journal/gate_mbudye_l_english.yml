 je_gate_mbudye: "Converting the [GetCulture('luba').GetNameNoFormatting]"
 je_gate_mbudye_reason: "The elves of the Arcturian Dominion view the conversion of the Luba as both a spiritual mission and a means of consolidating their theocratic rule. Their emissaries engage with the Mbudye, the venerated council of interpreters and historians, weaving the Dominion’s faith into the fabric of Luba tradition. While the elves claim to offer divine enlightenment, the Mbudye remain cautious, recognizing the subtle erosion of their sovereignty hidden within the elven scriptures. The struggle is one of persuasion and resistance, as ancient Luba principles clash with the Dominion's celestial decrees."

 mbudye.1.desc: "The [GetCulture('luba').GetName] nations under our control convert to the [GetReligion('golden_religion').GetName]."
 mbudye.1.f: "After years of tireless preaching, political maneuvering, and bitter conflict, the Luba have finally embraced the faith of the Golden Blessing. The Mbudye council, once staunch guardians of their ancestral traditions, now kneel in solemn prayer alongside elven priests. Yet the path to this moment was stained with blood and marred by strife—villages burned, families divided, and histories rewritten. As golden banners rise over Luba lands, the question lingers: will this new faith bring unity, or will old wounds fester beneath the surface?"
 mbudye.1.a: "Finally."

 mbudye.3.f: "An elven priest, adorned in the shimmering vestments of the Arcturian Dominion, approached a Luba village, intent on spreading the celestial faith. However, the villagers, united in their resolve, stood firm at the entrance, barring the priest’s path. “We honor our ancestors and their wisdom,” the village elder declared. The priest, though outwardly composed, returned with a heavy heart—and a report to the Dominion leaders, who now must decide how to handle this act of defiance."
 mbudye.3.a: "Burn down that Village"

 mbudye.4.f: "Tensions in the Luba lands erupted as news spread of the assassination of a prominent elven official by a shadowy [concept_bambudye] operative. The strike was precise and deliberate, a clear message from the secret society determined to free their people from Arcturian dominion. While the Dominion's priests condemned the act as barbaric, whispers among the Luba spoke of defiance and hope. The balance between rebellion and retaliation now hangs perilously, threatening to plunge the region into chaos."

The investigation, conducted with the precision and zeal characteristic of the Dominion, has traced the threads of conspiracy back to a hidden cell of Bambudye operatives. This revelation sends ripples through the region, promising both retribution and escalating tensions. Will the Dominion's response restore order—or ignite further rebellion?"

Whispers of defiance grow louder, as the unanswered crime becomes a symbol of rebellion."

 mbudye.6.b: "Nothing we can do."
