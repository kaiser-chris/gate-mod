 je_gate_mbudye: "Converting the [GetCulture('luba').GetNameNoFormatting]"
 je_gate_mbudye_reason: "The elves of the Arcturian Dominion view the conversion of the Luba as both a spiritual mission and a means of consolidating their theocratic rule. Their emissaries engage with the Mbudye, the venerated council of interpreters and historians, weaving the Dominion’s faith into the fabric of Luba tradition. While the elves claim to offer divine enlightenment, the Mbudye remain cautious, recognizing the subtle erosion of their sovereignty hidden within the elven scriptures. The struggle is one of persuasion and resistance, as ancient Luba principles clash with the Dominion's celestial decrees."

 mbudye.1.f: "After years of tireless preaching, political maneuvering, and bitter conflict, the Luba have finally embraced the faith of the Golden Blessing.
