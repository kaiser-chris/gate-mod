 mana_saturation.dragon_greenland.f: "In the heart of Greenland, where the cold gnaws deepest and the sun forgets to rise, the Ice Dragon stirs. Beneath glaciers older than time, its slumber ends, eyes gleaming like frozen stars. As it rises, the land shudders, and the air turns sharp with frost. It breathes, and the world responds—ice and snow surge, transforming the green expanse into a desolate white abyss. The dragon’s fury is brief but devastating, leaving only shattered ice and echoes of its terrible power. Greenland lies in ruin, but the creature, at last, is dead."
 mana_saturation.dragon_california.d: "A dragon awakened in [SCOPE.sState('dragon_california_state').GetName] and devastated it and the surrounding states."
 mana_saturation.dragon_california.f: "In the scorched heart of Death Valley, where the earth cracks and the air ripples with unbearable heat, the Fire Dragon awakens. Buried beneath the blistering sands, it uncoils, its scales glowing like molten rock. As it emerges, the ground trembles and the skies ignite. Flames dance along its wings, turning the desert into a blazing inferno. For a moment, the world burns with its rage, the heat intensifying until the very stones melt. When the dragon’s wrath subsides, California is left a charred wasteland, the echoes of its fury seared into the landscape."
 mana_saturation.dragon_kolyma.d: "A dragon awakened in [SCOPE.sState('dragon_kolyma_state').GetName] and devastated it and the surrounding states."
 mana_saturation.dragon_kolyma.f: "In the frozen wilderness of Siberia, where the wind howls with the breath of eternity, an ancient Ice Dragon stirs. Entombed beneath layers of permafrost, its awakening sends tremors through the tundra. With a single, frost-laden breath, it rises, turning the skies to silver and the ground to unyielding ice. Glaciers crack and rivers freeze mid-flow, as the dragon's icy wrath spreads across the land. The region falls silent, blanketed in eternal winter. When the dragon finally retreats into the shadows, Siberia lies shattered and frozen, a testament to its unyielding power."
 mana_saturation.dragon_himalaya.d: "A dragon awakened in [SCOPE.sState('dragon_himalaya_state').GetName] and devastated it and the surrounding states."
 mana_saturation.dragon_himalaya.f: "High atop Mount Everest, where the air is thin and the world touches the sky, an Air Elemental Dragon awakens. Born from the very winds that swirl around the peak, it materializes in a storm of cloud and gale. Its roar sends avalanches tumbling and the atmosphere spiraling into chaos. The dragon's wings whip the air into hurricanes, tearing through the region with the fury of a thousand tempests. When it finally dissipates into the ether, the mountain stands scarred and ravaged, its once-majestic slopes reduced to a windswept ruin, forever haunted by the dragon's spectral presence."
