 gate_expedition_reytu_deepholm.2.flavor: "The expedition's trade delegation, led by merchants with genuine interest in dwarven craftsmanship rather than exploitation, arrives with modest gifts of Earth-origin materials and samples of human manufacturing techniques. The dwarven trade council views this as a respectful overture and an opportunity to access novel resources unavailable on Ankaris."
 gate_expedition_reytu_deepholm.2.a: "Good."
 gate_expedition_reytu_deepholm.3.desc: "TODO"
 gate_expedition_reytu_deepholm.3.flavor: "The expedition's trade delegation approaches Deephold with arrogance, assuming dwarves will eagerly supply materials to "superior" human technology. Offers made are deliberately undervalued, with the expedition attempting to leverage their military advantage and newness to the planet as negotiating pressure. Dwarven leaders view this as insulting and exploitative."
