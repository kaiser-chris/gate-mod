 expedition_location_deephold_flavor: "Scout Report – Deephold Dwarven Citadel, Subterranean Access Assessment, Ankaris Expedition Log\n\n#lore The primary entrance to Deephold is carved into a sheer mountainside, framed by monumental pillars etched with angular runes that glow softly in response to approaching movement. A broad ramp descends into the earth, meticulously engineered for wagons and caravans, flanked by alcoves hosting stone guardians whose eyes gleam with faint animus. Within the upper galleries, the rock has been shaped into precise geometric patterns, with vaulted ceilings supported by carved columns doubling as conduits for light and air. Ambient mana is focused and ordered, channeled into subtle illumination and mechanical devices—elevators, gates, and traffic control systems—suggesting a culture that integrates magic into engineering rather than spectacle. Dwarven sentries maintain tight control over access points; they observe all arrivals with disciplined scrutiny, weapons at hand but not drawn. Initial contact yielded terse but civil exchanges, with clear emphasis on trade protocol and mutual benefit.#!"

 gate_expedition_reytu_deepholm.2.desc: "TODO"
 gate_expedition_reytu_deepholm.2.flavor: "The expedition's trade delegation, led by merchants with genuine interest in dwarven craftsmanship rather than exploitation, arrives with modest gifts of Earth-origin materials and samples of human manufacturing techniques. The dwarven trade council views this as a respectful overture and an opportunity to access novel resources unavailable on Ankaris."
 gate_expedition_reytu_deepholm.2.a: "Good."
 gate_expedition_reytu_deepholm.3.desc: "TODO"
 gate_expedition_reytu_deepholm.3.flavor: "The expedition's trade delegation approaches Deephold with arrogance, assuming dwarves will eagerly supply materials to "superior" human technology. Offers made are deliberately undervalued, with the expedition attempting to leverage their military advantage and newness to the planet as negotiating pressure. Dwarven leaders view this as insulting and exploitative."
