 expedition_location_gate_name: "Gate To Earth"
 expedition_location_gate_desc: "The Magic Gate we have come through. It is our link back to Earth."
 expedition_location_gate_flavor: "Expedition Log – Gate Perimeter, Ankaris Side\n\n#lore We've made it through. For the first time, our boots press into the soil of Ankaris beyond the threshold of the gate—now ours. The air is thick with residual magic and smoke long settled. Just beyond the arch lies the skeletal remains of a field camp: collapsed tents, broken crates, shattered arcane batteries. The sigils of the enemy are scorched into rusted armor and scorched banners, but no bodies remain. Whatever happened here, it ended in flight—or worse. The land is silent. No scouts, no sentries, not even carrion beasts. Only the wind moves, whistling through hollow frames and stirring ashes into the air like ghosts. The gate is secure, but the stillness is unsettling. We hold the threshold now—but Ankaris is watching.#!"
 expedition_location_village_name: "Village"
 expedition_location_village_desc: "A small [concept_gate_planet] village. How do we want to interact with them?"
 expedition_location_village_flavor: "Scout Report – Preliminary Village Assessment, Ankaris Expedition Log\n\n#lore The village lies nestled amid natural terrain, blending seamlessly into its surroundings. It appears largely self-sufficient, with cultivated land and strange domesticated creatures unfamiliar to our scholars. The buildings are low and practical, many reinforced with organic materials that pulse faintly with ambient mana. The locals have yet to approach, though they observe us from behind shimmering magical wards strung between rooftops and trees. Faint traces of enchantment are present throughout the area—subtle and widespread rather than concentrated—suggesting either a deep connection to their land or a cautious reserve. No direct contact has been made. Further observation recommended.#!"
 expedition_location_castle_name: "Castle"
 expedition_location_castle_desc: "An [concept_gate_planet] castle. How do we want to interact with them?"
 expedition_location_castle_flavor: "Scout Report – Fortified Hold, Ankaris Expedition Log\n\n#lore Our advance team has come upon a well-maintained castle rising from a low ridge above the nearby plain. The fortress appears fully occupied and in excellent condition, with smooth stonework, clean battlements, and freshly flown banners displaying a sigil unknown to our heraldry. The grounds show signs of regular patrols and disciplined upkeep, and a small village has grown around its outer walls, likely serving as support for the garrison and the lord’s court. No signs of conflict or unrest are evident—on the contrary, the area radiates stability and order. The central keep is topped with a glass-domed spire that emits a soft magical glow at night, suggesting the presence of arcane advisors or wards. The castle seems to be the seat of a local power, possibly a noble or governor, and could prove valuable for diplomatic overtures.#!"
 expedition_location_town_name: "Town"
 expedition_location_town_desc: "An [concept_gate_planet] town. How do we want to interact with them?"
 expedition_location_town_flavor: "Scout Report – Unknown Town Settlement, Ankaris Expedition Log\n\n#lore Initial recon has identified a sizable settlement nestled in a shallow valley, ringed by layered stone walls and wooden palisades reinforced with local minerals. The town appears to be self-sufficient, with terraced fields, wind-powered mills, and several elevated watchposts. Unlike the smaller villages we've passed, this location shows signs of deliberate organization—wide streets, district divisions, and a central spire that glows faintly with arcane energy at night. Movement is visible at the gates, and the populace seems alert but not openly hostile. Several banners are hung along the ramparts, though their meaning is still unknown. No direct contact has been initiated, but the size and structure suggest this town could serve as a local trade hub or even a regional seat of influence.#!"

 expedition_location_kaelmont_harbor_desc: ""
 expedition_location_kaelmont_harbor_flavor: "Scout Report – Kaelmont Harbor, Preliminary Coastal Assessment, Ankaris Expedition Log\n\n#lore The city rises in tiers from a natural deep-water inlet, its stone quays and wooden piers pressed tight against the curve of a sheltered bay. Defensive walls, recently repaired, bear scorch marks and impact fractures consistent with siege engines and magical assault. Traffic along the harbor remains steady: sail-driven vessels and mana-augmented craft move in and out with practiced rhythm, suggesting trade has resumed despite recent conflict. Local architecture favors stout stone bases with timber upper floors, some reinforced by visible runic inlays that glow faintly at dusk. Civic order appears stable; watch patrols are disciplined, and harbor officials conduct inspections with methodical efficiency. Attitudes toward outsiders are cautious but not hostile—several dockworkers observed, few willing to engage beyond basic transactional exchanges.#!"

 expedition_location_shadowfen_marshes_desc: ""
 expedition_location_shadowfen_marshes_flavor: "Scout Report – Shadowfen Marshes, Former Goblin Encampment Survey, Ankaris Expedition Log\n\n#lore The marsh sprawls across a low basin of stagnant channels and reed-choked pools, shrouded in perpetual mist. Ruined palisades of crude timber and bone protrude from the mire at irregular intervals—remnants of extensive fortifications now half-swallowed by mud. Fetishes of carved wood, teeth, and rusted metal hang from dead branches, many still resonant with unstable shamanic energies detectable even to untrained senses. The ground is treacherous; unseen sinkholes and pockets of corrupted mana complicate movement and threaten to ensnare men and beasts alike. Occasional firefly-like motes drift above the water’s surface, flaring brighter near old ritual sites before winking out. No organized goblin presence detected, but tracks and spoor suggest scavenger creatures and possibly isolated survivors. Extended exploration inadvisable without magical support and specialized kit. Area classified as hazardous; approach with extreme caution.#!"

 expedition_location_thornhaven_desc: ""
 expedition_location_thornhaven_flavor: "Scout Report – Thornhaven Library, Scholarly Citadel Observation, Ankaris Expedition Log\n\n#lore Thornhaven crowns a rocky hill, its outer walls merging with natural stone to form a seamless defensive shell. The complex presents as part fortress, part monastery: narrow windows, reinforced gates, and inward-facing courtyards ringed by cloistered walkways. Towers capped with slate roofs house observatories and, likely, arcane laboratories—subtle beams of structured mana occasionally lance skyward before dissipating. Within visible range, robed figures move with measured purpose along parapets and terraces, escorted at intervals by armed retainers whose armor bears the same sigil as the library’s banners. Ambient magic is pervasive but tightly controlled; wards are layered over doors, windows, and even footpaths, suggesting a strong emphasis on security and containment. No active hostility shown, but initial attempts to approach were met with polite, distant acknowledgment and a clear expectation that boundaries be respected.#!"

 expedition_location_shattered_spine_desc: ""
 expedition_location_shattered_spine_flavor: "Scout Report – The Shattered Spine, Anomalous Terrain Survey, Ankaris Expedition Log\n\n#lore The Shattered Spine stretches across the horizon in a jagged band of fractured ridges and crystalline outcrops, as if the land itself had been struck and splintered by some colossal force. Rock formations twist at impossible angles, occasionally suspended in defiance of gravity, held in place by unseen energies. Vegetation is sparse and warped: blackened trees exude faint phosphorescence, and hardy shrubs carry glass-like thorns humming with residual power. The air tastes metallic, and compasses lose reliability within a short distance of entry. Isolated pockets of concentrated mana manifest as wavering mirages or localized distortions in sound and light. No permanent habitation observed, though signs of previous expeditions—abandoned camps, broken tools, and scorched clearing sites—indicate intermittent incursions by treasure seekers and scholars. Prolonged exposure induces fatigue and disorientation among personnel.#!"

 expedition_location_deephold_desc: ""
 expedition_location_deephold_flavor: "Scout Report – Deephold Dwarven Citadel, Subterranean Access Assessment, Ankaris Expedition Log\n\n#lore The primary entrance to Deephold is carved into a sheer mountainside, framed by monumental pillars etched with angular runes that glow softly in response to approaching movement. A broad ramp descends into the earth, meticulously engineered for wagons and caravans, flanked by alcoves hosting stone guardians whose eyes gleam with faint animus. Within the upper galleries, the rock has been shaped into precise geometric patterns, with vaulted ceilings supported by carved columns doubling as conduits for light and air. Ambient mana is focused and ordered, channeled into subtle illumination and mechanical devices—elevators, gates, and traffic control systems—suggesting a culture that integrates magic into engineering rather than spectacle. Dwarven sentries maintain tight control over access points; they observe all arrivals with disciplined scrutiny, weapons at hand but not drawn. Initial contact yielded terse but civil exchanges, with clear emphasis on trade protocol and mutual benefit.#!"

 expedition_location_silverwood_desc: ""
 expedition_location_silverwood_flavor: "Scout Report – The Silverwood, Elven Territory Reconnaissance, Ankaris Expedition Log\n\n#lore The forest canopy of the Silverwood forms an unbroken tapestry of interlocking boughs, filtering sunlight into shifting patterns of silver and green. Trees rise to extraordinary heights, their trunks entwined with living platforms, bridges, and dwellings that blend so seamlessly with the foliage that they are nearly indistinguishable at a distance. The air is heavy with the scent of flowering vines and carries an undercurrent of structured natural magic: currents of mana flow through root and branch much like sap, palpable even at the forest edge. Wildlife displays unusual composure around scouting parties, observing without fear, as though reassured by unseen oversight. Elven presence is inferred rather than overt—occasional glimpses of movement high in the branches, faint music on the wind, and the subtle adjustment of paths that guide outsiders away from particularly sacred groves. No hostile acts encountered, but it is evident that every step is monitored.#!"

 expedition_location_crescent_bay_flavor: "Scout Report – Crescent Bay Trading Post, Commercial Hub Survey, Ankaris Expedition Log\n\n#lore Crescent Bay curves around a modest natural harbor, its shoreline lined with piers of varying construction and quality—some stout and well-maintained, others ramshackle and clearly temporary. The settlement itself consists of layered expansions: original stone warehouses near the water, later wooden structures crowding behind them, and canvas awnings extending into open-air markets. Flags, totems, and painted symbols from multiple cultures flutter above stalls, indicating a wide array of visiting merchants and local patrons. The atmosphere is busy but controlled; disputes are quickly mediated by neutral wardens whose armbands and subtle binding charms command respect. Magic is present in practical forms—warded lockboxes, temperature-stabilized storage, translation charms—but rarely flaunted. Residents display a practiced indifference to newcomers, treating all as potential customers rather than threats or curiosities.#!"

 expedition_location_ashcrest_ruins_flavor: "Scout Report – Ashcrest Ruins, Abandoned City Survey, Ankaris Expedition Log\n\n#lore Ashcrest occupies a broad plateau overlooking a valley, its once-grand avenues now choked with windblown dust and encroaching vegetation. Multi-story stone structures, many still standing, display intricate reliefs and inlaid channels suggestive of integrated magical systems—now dormant or broken in most cases. Central plazas contain cracked obelisks and dry fountains whose basins carry faint residue of old enchantments. The silence of the place is striking; no permanent inhabitants observed, and even animal life appears sparse within the city bounds. Instruments detect low-level magical background radiation, steady but non-hostile, as if remnants of the city’s former power continue to seep into the environment. Scattered personal effects—ceramics, tools, fragments of clothing—hint at a rapid departure rather than a gradual decline.#!"
