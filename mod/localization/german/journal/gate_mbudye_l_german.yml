# Conversion Journal Entry
 je_gate_mbudye: "Converting the [GetCulture('lunda').GetNameNoFormatting]"
 je_gate_mbudye_reason: "The elves of the Arcturian Dominion view the conversion of the Lunda as both a spiritual mission and a means of consolidating their theocratic rule. Their emissaries engage with the Mbudye, the venerated council of interpreters and historians, weaving the Dominion’s faith into the fabric of Lunda tradition. While the elves claim to offer divine enlightenment, the Mbudye remain cautious, recognizing the subtle erosion of their sovereignty hidden within the elven scriptures. The struggle is one of persuasion and resistance, as ancient Lunda principles clash with the Dominion's celestial decrees."

 mbudye.1.t: "The Golden Conversion"
 mbudye.1.desc: "The [GetCulture('lunda').GetName] nations under our control convert to the [GetReligion('golden_religion').GetName]."
 mbudye.1.f: "After years of tireless preaching, political maneuvering, and bitter conflict, the Lunda have finally embraced the faith of the Golden Blessing. The Mbudye council, once staunch guardians of their ancestral traditions, now kneel in solemn prayer alongside elven priests. Yet the path to this moment was stained with blood and marred by strife—villages burned, families divided, and histories rewritten. As golden banners rise over Lunda lands, the question lingers: will this new faith bring unity, or will old wounds fester beneath the surface?"
 mbudye.1.a: "Finally."
 mbudye.2.t: "The Drums of Unity"
 mbudye.2.desc: "The [GetCulture('lunda').GetName] nations unify and start an uprising against us."
 mbudye.2.f: "In an unprecedented act of defiance, the Lunda nations set aside their differences, forging an alliance to confront the dominion of the Arcturian elves. Across the land, the drums of unity echoed, rallying warriors and leaders alike. For the first time, the fragmented states presented a unified front, their resolve sharpened by shared grievances and a collective yearning for freedom from their otherworldly occupiers."
 mbudye.2.a: "We will crush them."
 mbudye.3.t: "Priest Turned Away"
 mbudye.3.desc: "A priest of the [GetReligion('golden_religion').GetName] has been turned away from a village in the state of [SCOPE.sState('mbudye_event_state').GetName] in [SCOPE.sCountry('mbudye_event_country').GetNameNoFlag]."
 mbudye.3.f: "An elven priest, adorned in the shimmering vestments of the Arcturian Dominion, approached a Lunda village, intent on spreading the celestial faith. However, the villagers, united in their resolve, stood firm at the entrance, barring the priest’s path. “We honor our ancestors and their wisdom,” the village elder declared. The priest, though outwardly composed, returned with a heavy heart—and a report to the Dominion leaders, who now must decide how to handle this act of defiance."
 mbudye.3.a: "Burn down that Village"
 mbudye.3.b: "Send a stern missive to the [SCOPE.sCountry('mbudye_event_country').GetNameNoFlag] [concept_mbudye_council]."

 mbudye.4.f: "Tensions in the Lunda lands erupted as news spread of the assassination of a prominent elven official by a shadowy [concept_bambudye] operative. The strike was precise and deliberate, a clear message from the secret society determined to free their people from Arcturian dominion. While the Dominion's priests condemned the act as barbaric, whispers among the Lunda spoke of defiance and hope. The balance between rebellion and retaliation now hangs perilously, threatening to plunge the region into chaos."
 mbudye.4.a: "Make an Example in [SCOPE.sState('mbudye_event_state').GetName]."

 mbudye.5.f: "After weeks of meticulous inquiry, the elven authorities have identified the individuals responsible for the heinous act. The investigation, conducted with the precision and zeal characteristic of the Dominion, has traced the threads of conspiracy back to a hidden cell of Bambudye operatives. This revelation sends ripples through the region, promising both retribution and escalating tensions. Will the Dominion's response restore order—or ignite further rebellion?"
 mbudye.5.a: "Execute them publicly."
 mbudye.5.b: "Give them a fair trial."

 mbudye.6.desc: "We could not find the people responsible for [SCOPE.sCountry('gate_mbudye_dominion').MakeScope.Var('mbudye_investigation').GetFlagName]."
 mbudye.6.f: "Despite the efforts of the Dominion's most skilled investigators, the trail has gone cold. Evidence points to the Bambudye, yet no culprits have been apprehended. The elusive nature of the resistance casts doubt on the Dominion's control, leaving frustration among officials and unease among the populace. Whispers of defiance grow louder, as the unanswered crime becomes a symbol of rebellion."

 mbudye.7.f: "Tragedy struck as one of our esteemed generals was ambushed and assassinated during a diplomatic visit to a Lunda subject state. The assailants melted into the crowd, leaving behind shock and outrage. Tensions with the local populace simmer as accusations fly, and the Dominion vows swift retribution.

 mbudye.12.f: "A public ceremony meant to honor shared harmony descends into chaos as elven clergy misinterpret a Lunda ritual as heretical.

Under the cover of darkness, their operatives infiltrated Arcturian supply depots, setting stores of food, weapons, and mana crystals ablaze.
