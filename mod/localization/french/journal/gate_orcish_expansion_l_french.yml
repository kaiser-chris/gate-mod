 je_gate_orcish_expansion: "Claim of Verdant Right"
 je_gate_orcish_expansion_reason: "From the scorched steppes of Ankaris, the cries of the Orkish kin echo with hunger and resolve. Their homeland—sun-bleached and unforgiving—can no longer sustain them. Led by a doctrine of survival and ancestral strength, the Orkish Supremacy now sets its gaze upon the fertile lands of Earth. To them, this is not conquest—it is reclamation. A rightful claim to soil that can feed their bloodline, and a warning to those who would deny them a future: the Orks do not ask. They take."
