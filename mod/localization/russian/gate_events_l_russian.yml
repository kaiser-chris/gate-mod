 gate_country_events.1.f: "The miraculous regrowth of the Donareiche has stirred something deep within the soul of the people. As its mighty branches once again stretch skyward, many see it as a divine sign—proof that the gods of their ancestors still watch over the land. Temples long silent echo once more with ancient hymns, and old rites find new life in village clearings and forest glades. The old faith, long buried beneath centuries of doctrine, rises with the strength of roots rediscovered. Across the nation, oak leaves are worn with pride—and the thunder is no longer feared, but revered."
