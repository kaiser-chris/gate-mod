Their rulers remain in name only, bound by elven might and diplomacy to serve their new overlords. While some see this arrangement as an opportunity to harness the Dominion’s power, others resent the loss of autonomy and yearn for the days of true independence. Beneath the surface, the spirit of the Lunda people endures, simmering with the hope of reclaiming their destiny."

 TSW_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Faced with the growing threat of colonization by European powers, the Tswana sought the protection of the $GATE_AD$. By entering into a protectorate agreement, they preserved a degree of autonomy, choosing elven overlords over complete subjugation. While their decision has shielded them from foreign conquest, it has also brought new challenges as they navigate life under the Dominion’s watchful gaze. For now, the Tswana strive to maintain their identity, hoping their alliance secures their future without eroding their sovereignty."
