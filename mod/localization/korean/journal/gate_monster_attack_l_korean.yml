Their pleas for protection had been dismissed, their warnings ignored. Left to their own devices, they fought back with whatever they could muster—makeshift barricades, hunting rifles, torches, and sheer desperation. The battle was chaotic and grim, courage born from necessity as they stood against the beasts. Though some managed to fell the creatures with fire and steel, the cost was staggering. Entire towns were left in ruins, and countless lives were lost."
