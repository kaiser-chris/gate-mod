 - Improved some flavor texts
 - Added lore [wiki entry](https://github.com/kaiser-chris/gate-mod/wiki/Min-Raetia) for Min Raetia

## Mana Crystal Rework
 - Mana Extractors now have a max level that depends on the mana density in a state
 - Starting from a medium mana density, a state will support 2 mana extractors
 - When the mana density in a state reaches a high mana density, it will support 3 mana extractors
 - The technology Mana Extraction will also add 1 more max level
 - And finally, the Ritual Magic technology will add another level to the max level
 - So in the end, you will be able to build a maximum of 5 Mana Extractors per state
