# 0.7.0 - Rune Carving & Mana Stabilization

## Min Raetia
 - Added more Dwarven and German integration events
 - After integrating their German population, Min Raetia will no longer get German unification journal entries
 - Improved some flavor texts
 - Added lore [wiki entry](https://github.com/kaiser-chris/gate-mod/wiki/Min-Raetia) for Min Raetia

## Rune Carving
 - There is a new Technology called Simple Rune Carving
 - Rune Carving comes with one intermediate good called Rune Etched Paper
 - Rune Etched Paper can be produced at Paper Mills for the cost of reducing normal Paper production
 - Buildings like Tool Workshops and some other production buildings can use Rune Etched Paper to boost their production

## Mana Stabilization Rework
 - Mana Extractors now have a max level that depends on the mana density in a state
 - Starting from a medium mana density, a state will support 2 mana extractors
 - When the mana density in a state reaches a high mana density, it will support 3 mana extractors
 - The technology Mana Stabilization will also add 1 more max level
 - And finally, the Ritual Magic technology will add another level to the max level
 - So in the end, you will be able to build a maximum of 5 Mana Extractors per state
