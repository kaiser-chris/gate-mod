This patch makes Manaflow compatible with patch **1.10.3**
# 0.23.3 - Balancing Kaffee
## Balancing
- Rune-Guard Infantry offense changed from 20 to 25
- Rune-Guard Infantry now needs Runic Paper instead of Mana Cores (this should reduce cost)
- Druidic Circles now provide 2% instead of 5% pollution reduction to the Magical Proliferation institution for a maximum of 10%
## Bugfixes
- Magic Research Institutes will now be properly cleaned up when they are in conquered states
- Added missing translations
