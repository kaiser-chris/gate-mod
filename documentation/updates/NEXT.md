# 0.0.0 - Military

Please come up with new magic or magitech unit types that fit in with the existing unit types below or improve on them.
The idea is to provide a set of magic alternative and merged unit types.

These are the existing units:
## Irregular Infantry
Units that do not follow traditional military organization standards.

## Line Infantry
Organized in two to four ranks of soldiers to maximize their firepower.

## Skirmish Infantry
Light Infantry which is positioned in a loose formation, allowing a high degree of flexibility.

## Trench Infantry
These units make use of dug trenches to fortify their position.

## Squad Infantry
Small groups that can act independently from their army organization.

## Mechanized Infantry
Supported by heavily armored vehicles to provide cover.
