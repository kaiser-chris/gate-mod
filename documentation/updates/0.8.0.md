# 0.8.0 - Tech Rework

## Mana Cores
- Mana Cores now depend on Railways to be researched
- Mana Cores can now be used for Mana Trains in Railway buildings

## Balancing
- Speed up Mana propagation in South America even more
- Slowed down Mana Saturation journal entry so it will finish quite close to the whole world being covered in mana
- Reduced cost of Golems
