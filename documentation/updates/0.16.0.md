# 0.16.0 - Morgenröte & Mana Crystals

## Morgenröte
- Added support for the Morgenröte flavor mod
- The Magic Researcher will be shown as an Academic in Morgenröte
- Morgenröte University focus is now supported
- No compatibility patch is needed

## Mana Crystals
In later stages of the game, Mana Crystals become an extremely limited resource.
To mitigate these shortages, new technologies have been added:
- **Efficient Mana Collection:** Which allows for more Mana Extractors to be built in a state
- **Ley Line Tapping:** This allows building Mana Wells which do not have a limit, but are less efficient than Mana Extractors and more expensive

## Minor Changes
- Improved Germanic conversion decision

## Translation
