# 0.19.0 - Echoes of the Concord
*The unity of the Ursalith thunders across Ankaris, while Earth’s lands change forever under paw and spell.*

This update makes Manaflow compatible with version **1.9.0** of Victoria 3. 

## General
All gate nations now have immigration through the gate.
This allows for easier scaling and also fits better into the story.

## New Nation
Added a new country in Alaska called the **Ursalith Concord**:

> Forged from the once-fractured clans of the Aruqta, the Ursalith Concord stands as a testament to unity in adversity. Hardened by the frozen wastes of Ankaris and tempered by the long struggle for survival, this centralized but clan-rooted nation of bearfolk seeks to protect its ancient ways while asserting its place in the world’s new magical age.

## Texas
- Texas is now geographically bigger and has a sizable bearfolk population
- The Sunnarok bearfolk fled to the region after being driven out of the Ursalith Concord
- After their integration into Texas, the nation became stronger and also learned how to wield magic

> Once a frontier republic, Texas now stands transformed — its fate forever changed by the arrival of the Sunnarok, a displaced clan of Ursalith bearfolk driven south by their Aruqta kin. Traveling the frozen reaches of Ankaris through the magic gate, the Sunnarok brought with them arcane knowledge long unknown to Earth’s peoples. This unlikely alliance forged a new, resilient Texas — one where rifle and rune stand side by side.
