## Kaelmont Harbor — Primary Port City
### Description
The largest settlement on Reytu's northern coast and the continent's main hub for maritime trade. Home to approximately 15,000 inhabitants, Kaelmont features a natural deep-water harbor protected by rocky headlands. The city bore the brunt of the initial goblin invasion but was successfully defended by a coalition of human forces. Scouts should investigate the city's reconstruction efforts, establish diplomatic contact with local leadership, and assess the condition of the harbor infrastructure. The city's archives likely contain detailed records of the goblin invasion and maps of Reytu's interior.

The city rises in tiers from a natural deep-water inlet, its stone quays and wooden piers pressed tight against the curve of a sheltered bay. Defensive walls, recently repaired, bear scorch marks and impact fractures consistent with siege engines and magical assault. Traffic along the harbor remains steady: sail-driven vessels and mana-augmented craft move in and out with practiced rhythm, suggesting trade has resumed despite recent conflict. Local architecture favors stout stone bases with timber upper floors, some reinforced by visible runic inlays that glow faintly at dusk. Civic order appears stable; watch patrols are disciplined, and harbor officials conduct inspections with methodical efficiency. Attitudes toward outsiders are cautious but not hostile—several dockworkers observed, few willing to engage beyond basic transactional exchanges. Diplomatic contact recommended under controlled conditions.

## Shadowfen Marshes — Goblin Occupation Zone
### Description
A vast wetland region in central Reytu where goblin forces established their primary stronghold before pivoting to the sealed gate. The marshes span approximately 200 square miles and contain remnants of goblin military encampments, destroyed fortifications, and scattered artifacts. Scouts report evidence of shamanic ritual circles and enchanted barriers—likely created by goblin shamans to protect their stronghold. The region remains partially hazardous due to residual magic and potentially surviving goblin resistance. Archaeological investigation could reveal crucial intelligence about goblin military organization and shamanic capabilities.

The marsh sprawls across a low basin of stagnant channels and reed-choked pools, shrouded in perpetual mist. Ruined palisades of crude timber and bone protrude from the mire at irregular intervals—remnants of extensive fortifications now half-swallowed by mud. Fetishes of carved wood, teeth, and rusted metal hang from dead branches, many still resonant with unstable shamanic energies detectable even to untrained senses. The ground is treacherous; unseen sinkholes and pockets of corrupted mana complicate movement and threaten to ensnare men and beasts alike. Occasional firefly-like motes drift above the water’s surface, flaring brighter near old ritual sites before winking out. No organized goblin presence detected, but tracks and spoor suggest scavenger creatures and possibly isolated survivors. Extended exploration inadvisable without magical support and specialized kit. Area classified as hazardous; approach with extreme caution.

## The Sealed Gate of Vehn — Interdimensional Portal Site
### Description
Located within a fortified stone sanctuary in the foothills of the Kethral Mountains, the sealed gate stands as humanity's primary objective on Reytu. The structure is ancient, possibly predating known Reytu civilization, and was partially damaged during the goblin-Chinese conflict. Goblin shamans performed a sealing ritual here, leaving traces of powerful magic that the expedition's own mages must analyze. Scouts should document the gate's architecture, collect samples of the sealing magic, and search the surrounding sanctuary for records about other gates or information left by previous expeditions.
### Flavor
Scout Report – The Sealed Gate of Vehn, Portal Site Reconnaissance, Ankaris Expedition Log
The gate stands within a walled sanctuary set against the lower slopes of a mountain range, accessible by a single winding approach road flanked by abandoned watchtowers. The central structure is a monumental arch of unknown stone, veined with metallic channels that no longer conduct visible energy. Its surface bears layered inscriptions—some carefully carved and ordered, others gouged or scorched as if added or defaced during later conflicts. At the arch’s heart, where an aperture should exist, only a dull, glass-smooth plane remains, cool to the touch and utterly inert. Residual magical signatures are pronounced and discordant, indicating multiple overlapping rituals, the most recent aligned with goblin shamanic practice. The surrounding complex shows signs of hurried occupation and retreat: overturned altars, broken talismans, and hastily buried refuse pits. No guardians, human or otherwise, presently observed. Site is secure for now, but any attempt to tamper with the seal should be preceded by exhaustive study.

## Thornhaven Library — Center of Knowledge
### Description
A fortress-monastery built into a hillside in the western highlands, Thornhaven serves as Reytu's primary repository of written knowledge and magical learning. The institution survived the goblin invasion through its remote location and defensive wards. Its extensive library contains pre-invasion historical records, bestiary information about Reytu's creatures, technical treatises on Ankaris-level magic, and potentially manuscripts describing the gates or the ancient god-conflict that devastated Ankaris. Negotiating access to these archives should be a high priority for the expedition's scholars.
### Flavor
Scout Report – Thornhaven Library, Scholarly Citadel Observation, Ankaris Expedition Log
Thornhaven crowns a rocky hill, its outer walls merging with natural stone to form a seamless defensive shell. The complex presents as part fortress, part monastery: narrow windows, reinforced gates, and inward-facing courtyards ringed by cloistered walkways. Towers capped with slate roofs house observatories and, likely, arcane laboratories—subtle beams of structured mana occasionally lance skyward before dissipating. Within visible range, robed figures move with measured purpose along parapets and terraces, escorted at intervals by armed retainers whose armor bears the same sigil as the library’s banners. Ambient magic is pervasive but tightly controlled; wards are layered over doors, windows, and even footpaths, suggesting a strong emphasis on security and containment. No active hostility shown, but initial attempts to approach were met with polite, distant acknowledgment and a clear expectation that boundaries be respected. Formal petition for entry and parley advised.

## The Shattered Spine — Magically Devastated Badlands
### Description
A vast region of twisted, barren terrain in southern Reytu marked by the residual effects of ancient magical warfare. The landscape features crystallized formations, areas of unstable reality, pools of stagnant magical energy, and vegetation corrupted into unrecognizable forms. Local inhabitants avoid this zone except for desperate treasure hunters and rare-material gatherers. The region may contain artifacts from the ancient god-conflict, including weapons, knowledge, or resources unavailable elsewhere. Expedition scouts should investigate with extreme caution and magical protection, as the environment poses unknown hazards.
### Flavor
Scout Report – The Shattered Spine, Anomalous Terrain Survey, Ankaris Expedition Log
The Shattered Spine stretches across the horizon in a jagged band of fractured ridges and crystalline outcrops, as if the land itself had been struck and splintered by some colossal force. Rock formations twist at impossible angles, occasionally suspended in defiance of gravity, held in place by unseen energies. Vegetation is sparse and warped: blackened trees exude faint phosphorescence, and hardy shrubs carry glass-like thorns humming with residual power. The air tastes metallic, and compasses lose reliability within a short distance of entry. Isolated pockets of concentrated mana manifest as wavering mirages or localized distortions in sound and light. No permanent habitation observed, though signs of previous expeditions—abandoned camps, broken tools, and scorched clearing sites—indicate intermittent incursions by treasure seekers and scholars. Prolonged exposure induces fatigue and disorientation among personnel. Region classified as extremely unstable; only small, well-prepared teams should proceed.

## Deephold Dwarven Citadel — Underground Kingdom
### Description
An extensive underground city carved into the mountains of eastern Reytu, home to approximately 8,000 dwarves who maintained neutrality during the goblin invasion. The dwarves possess advanced metallurgy and stonework technology that rivals or exceeds 1800s Earth standards. Deephold's relationship with the human settlements on Reytu is cordial but distant. Scouts should establish formal diplomatic contact, assess the dwarves' technological capabilities, and determine their willingness to trade valuable minerals and crafted goods. Understanding their perspective on the gate opening and foreign humans is strategically important.

The primary entrance to Deephold is carved into a sheer mountainside, framed by monumental pillars etched with angular runes that glow softly in response to approaching movement. A broad ramp descends into the earth, meticulously engineered for wagons and caravans, flanked by alcoves hosting stone guardians whose eyes gleam with faint animus. Within the upper galleries, the rock has been shaped into precise geometric patterns, with vaulted ceilings supported by carved columns doubling as conduits for light and air. Ambient mana is focused and ordered, channeled into subtle illumination and mechanical devices—elevators, gates, and traffic control systems—suggesting a culture that integrates magic into engineering rather than spectacle. Dwarven sentries maintain tight control over access points; they observe all arrivals with disciplined scrutiny, weapons at hand but not drawn. Initial contact yielded terse but civil exchanges, with clear emphasis on trade protocol and mutual benefit. Further engagement should prioritize respect for hierarchy and craftsmanship.

## The Silverwood — Elven Enclave
### Description
An ancient forest in northern Reytu where the continent's elf population maintains traditional settlements integrated with the living trees and natural environment. The elves are known to be skilled in nature-based magic and possess records dating back thousands of years. They largely avoided direct involvement in the goblin invasion, though they provided some aid to human settlements. Scouts should approach with formal ceremony and respect for elven customs. The elves may possess knowledge about Ankaris's history, the god-conflict, and magical phenomena that would be invaluable to the expedition.
### Flavor

The forest canopy of the Silverwood forms an unbroken tapestry of interlocking boughs, filtering sunlight into shifting patterns of silver and green. Trees rise to extraordinary heights, their trunks entwined with living platforms, bridges, and dwellings that blend so seamlessly with the foliage that they are nearly indistinguishable at a distance. The air is heavy with the scent of flowering vines and carries an undercurrent of structured natural magic: currents of mana flow through root and branch much like sap, palpable even at the forest edge. Wildlife displays unusual composure around scouting parties, observing without fear, as though reassured by unseen oversight. Elven presence is inferred rather than overt—occasional glimpses of movement high in the branches, faint music on the wind, and the subtle adjustment of paths that guide outsiders away from particularly sacred groves. No hostile acts encountered, but it is evident that every step is monitored. Diplomatically sensitive area; approach with ceremony and patience.

## Crescent Bay Trading Post — Neutral Ground
### Description
A modest port settlement on Reytu's southeastern coast that has developed a reputation as neutral trading ground where merchants from different races and settlements exchange goods and information. The post was established roughly 30 years prior to the gate opening and survived the goblin invasion through its peripheral location and lack of strategic value. Local merchants maintain intelligence networks and connections throughout Reytu. Scouts should use this location to gather information from traders, hire local guides, and assess trade opportunities that could fund expedition operations.
### Flavor
Scout Report – Crescent Bay Trading Post, Commercial Hub Survey, Ankaris Expedition Log
Crescent Bay curves around a modest natural harbor, its shoreline lined with piers of varying construction and quality—some stout and well-maintained, others ramshackle and clearly temporary. The settlement itself consists of layered expansions: original stone warehouses near the water, later wooden structures crowding behind them, and canvas awnings extending into open-air markets. Flags, totems, and painted symbols from multiple cultures flutter above stalls, indicating a wide array of visiting merchants and local patrons. The atmosphere is busy but controlled; disputes are quickly mediated by neutral wardens whose armbands and subtle binding charms command respect. Magic is present in practical forms—warded lockboxes, temperature-stabilized storage, translation charms—but rarely flaunted. Residents display a practiced indifference to newcomers, treating all as potential customers rather than threats or curiosities. An ideal node for intelligence gathering, supply acquisition, and recruitment of local guides. Influence here will likely yield disproportionate benefits.

## The Ork Plateau — Tribal Confederation Lands
### Description
A highland region in western Reytu inhabited by several ork tribes organized into loose confederations. The orks are primarily pastoral and warrior-focused, with a culture emphasizing honor and martial prowess. They remained neutral during the goblin invasion but lost warriors to conflicts defending their territories. The orks are intrigued by the expedition's arrival but are deeply mistrustful of outsiders. Scouts should be prepared to demonstrate respect through combat skill or magical ability. Establishing alliance with the orks could provide the expedition with valuable fighters and guides familiar with Reytu's wilderness.
### Flavor
Scout Report – The Ork Plateau, Tribal Territory Reconnaissance, Ankaris Expedition Log
The plateau rises in broad, wind-swept steps, covered in resilient grasses and scattered stands of stunted trees shaped by persistent gusts. Ork encampments occupy the higher ground: circular clusters of hide tents and timber structures encircling central fire pits, flanked by crude but effective wooden training grounds and watch posts. Herds of sturdy, horned beasts graze under the watch of armed riders, their tack decorated with clan colors and personal totems. The orks observed move with a warrior’s discipline, conducting regular drills and ritualized contests that appear to serve both training and social functions. Magic here is visceral rather than refined—battle chants, spirit-marks painted on skin, and totem poles that thrum faintly in step with the tribe’s collective energy. Initial sightings of the expedition were met with direct, appraising stares rather than fear or overt aggression. Negotiations will likely hinge on demonstrations of strength, honor, and reliability rather than abstract promises.

## Ashcrest Ruins — Ancient Civilization Site
### Description
The remnants of a pre-goblin invasion human settlement located on a plateau in central Reytu, abandoned approximately 400 years ago for unknown reasons. The ruins feature sophisticated stone construction and evidence of advanced magical application in architecture. Local folklore suggests the city was destroyed by magical plague or conflict with other races. The site remains largely unexplored due to local superstitions about curses. Scouts should conduct archaeological investigation to determine why the civilization collapsed, search for preserved records or artifacts, and assess whether residual magical hazards exist. The site may contain knowledge about gate technology or the ancient magical conflict.
### Flavor
Scout Report – Ashcrest Ruins, Abandoned City Survey, Ankaris Expedition Log
Ashcrest occupies a broad plateau overlooking a valley, its once-grand avenues now choked with windblown dust and encroaching vegetation. Multi-story stone structures, many still standing, display intricate reliefs and inlaid channels suggestive of integrated magical systems—now dormant or broken in most cases. Central plazas contain cracked obelisks and dry fountains whose basins carry faint residue of old enchantments. The silence of the place is striking; no permanent inhabitants observed, and even animal life appears sparse within the city bounds. Instruments detect low-level magical background radiation, steady but non-hostile, as if remnants of the city’s former power continue to seep into the environment. Scattered personal effects—ceramics, tools, fragments of clothing—hint at a rapid departure rather than a gradual decline. Local guides refused to approach within visible distance, citing curses and ill fortune associated with overnight stays. Area is stable for short visits, but unknown long-term effects warrant caution and staged exploration.
