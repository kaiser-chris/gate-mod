## Premise
In 1814, a series of Magic Gates to the planet **Ankaris** appeared across Earth,
forever altering the course of history.

## Ankaris
Ankaris is a planet that is made up of different races.
From Orks, Dwarves, Elves and others.
Magic is commonplace there. In some ways it resembles a world from a classic fantasy.

Though it is developed much more in a lot of places. Technology on Ankaris mirrors earth around 1800 in some ways and through magic sometimes exceeds it.
A lot of Ankaris surface is marked through magical conflict. Thousands of years ago a conflict between what we would call gods devastated the planet in a lot of ways.
It's not post apocalyptic though there are zones and locations which are not fit for habitation normally and are often only livable through the application of specific magic.

## Reytu

Reytu is an island continent on Ankaris.
It is European in its climate.
Just before the gates to earth opened it was suffering from a Goblin invasion.
They were poised to take over the island, but before they could the gates opened and one of them opened on the continent.

The goblins pivoted their invasion to the gate which linked to Qing China.
The Qing beat back the goblins, but before the Chinese could take the Gate the goblin shamans closed and sealed it.

While the Qing were left studying the now closed gate the human forces on Reytu destroyed the surviving goblins.
Though they never learned/found out about the gate, so it was left unattended.
