# Dev Diary 1

I am currently working on mechanics to visualize expeditions into the Magic Gate.
For now, only the Gate in the Great Qing will get a full expedition since there will be a lot of work needed to implement them.

Different from the base game, they will not just be a Journal Entry and a few Events, but will receive their own full-blown GUI and mechanics.

### Embarking on an Expedition
The following process is something I have already partially implemented. You can see some early results from my attached screenshots.

This is how an expedition is executed:
 - Expeditions cannot be started instantly but will need proper preparations
 - First, you will need to appoint an Expedition Leader who can be either having Industrial, Political or Military connections this will influence the possible interactions in the expedition itself 
 - So at the start of the expedition, you will need to choose how many resources you want to equip them with
 - Then there will be a preparation stage where the gate stockpiles those resources until the necessary amount is collected
 - When you then embark on the expedition, a new fullscreen panel will be available to manage its progress and goals
 - The panel will contain a map as well as information about the current supply status and morale

### Expedition Outcomes
These are the most in flux at the moment, but here are my ideas:
 - Resource income from secured places on Ankaris
 - Unique magic technologies or research boosts
 - Possible source of immigration or slaves

This is it for my first dev diary. I hope you like where this is heading, but if not, I would love to have some feedback.
