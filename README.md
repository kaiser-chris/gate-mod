# Overview

Magic Gate is a mod for Victoria 3.

THIS MOD IS UNFINISHED AND STILL IN DEVELOPMENT!

## Story

In 1814 multiple Magic Gates to the planet of Athora opened all around Earth. 

Athora is a magical planet with Dwarves, Elves and other races.
When the Gates opened, some spilled out conquering armies like the Orcs in Central America or the Arcturian Dominion in Africa.

While others choose to work with the powers on Earth like the Dwarves of Min Raetia who live in the Alps and choose to enter into a Personal Union with Bavaria.

## Credit

 - The new races were created by [Realms of Exether](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3279217222) and are used with permission

## Art

This mod uses AI generated art from [DeviantArt DreamUp](https://www.deviantart.com/dreamup).
According to their TOS full copy right is with the generating person so publication and changes are not a problem.

This should be a temporary measure since I am not able to create proper art for the mod myself.
I would love to have other people contribute art to the mod. 

## Problems & Incompatibilities

## Wishlist

Below are wishes for the future that are currently unrealistic because of engine and time limitations.

 - Add the planet of Athora as a fully playable world to the game
   - Not as a replacement but both planets at once
   - With fog of war mechanic like EU4
