# Overview

Magic Gate is a mod for Victoria 3.

THIS MOD IS UNFINISHED AND STILL IN DEVELOPMENT!

## Story

In 1814 multiple Magic Gates to the planet of Eitov opened all around Earth. 

Eitov is a magical planet with Dwarves, Elves and other races.
When the Gates opened, some spilled out conquering armies like the Orcs in Central America or the Arcturian Dominion in Africa.

While others choose to work with the powers on Earth like the Dwarves of Min Raetia who live in the Alps and choose to enter into a Personal Union with Bavaria.
