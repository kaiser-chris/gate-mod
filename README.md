## Story
In 1814, a series of Magic Gates to the planet **Ankaris** appeared across Earth,
forever altering the course of history.

Ankaris, a mystical world inhabited by Dwarves, Elves, and other fantastical races, brought both wonder and conflict.
Some arrivals unleashed chaos, such as the Orkish hordes that swept through Central America or the Arcturian Dominion
whose conquest reshaped parts of Africa.

Others sought cooperation, like the Dwarves of Min Raetia,
who settled in the Alps and formed a unique Personal Union with Bavaria,
blending their ancient traditions with Earthly governance.
